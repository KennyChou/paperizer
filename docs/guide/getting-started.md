# Getting Started

## Overview

Paperizer is a composable written in Typescript. It is a complete rewrite of the Vue mixin [Vue HTML to Paper](https://github.com/mycure-inc/vue-html-to-paper) created by [Joff Tiquez](https://github.com/jofftiquez).

This composable provides compatibility with Vue 3 projects but currently does not support Vue 2. For Vue 2 projects, you can still use [Vue HTML to Paper](https://github.com/mycure-inc/vue-html-to-paper).

## Installation

Install `paperizer` using your favorite package manager.


::: code-group
